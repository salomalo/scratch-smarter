=== WordPoints ===

== Change Log ==

This is the user change log for older versions of WordPoints. The change log for the
most recent versions are kept in readme.txt. A developer change log is available
here: https://github.com/WordPoints/wordpoints/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md

= 2.2.2 â€” 2017-01-14 =

##### Fixed

- Event reactions for custom post types not awarding points. Plugins like bbPress
were effected by this, because they register their post types later in the code
than WordPoints expected. This is now fixed so that WordPoints will work correctly
for post types no matter how late they are registered.

= 2.2.1 â€” 2017-01-03 =

##### Fixed

- The Points Types screen locking up when creating a new reaction for some events.
This only affected events where conditions could be created for items that could
relate to another item of the same type (like how a comment could have a parent
comment), causing an infinite loop.
- Points values not being formatted with the prefix if the suffix wasn't set, and
vice versa. This would only happen when the value wasn't set at all, not just when it
was empty, and so only applies to points types that were created programmatically.
Points types created through the UI were still formatted as expected.

= 2.2.0 â€” 2016-12-08 =

**Requires: WordPress 4.6+**

##### Changed

- Rate Limits for event reactions to now support setting the number of
minutes/hours/etc. Previously it was only possible to have rate limits of "once per
minute" or "once per day", now a rate limit can be "once every 5 minutes" or "once
every 2 days" or any other amount that you want.
- Points log entries that are hidden from some users to now be marked as such when a
user who is allowed to see them is viewing them. For example, if a post is not
public, only users who can view that post can view any points logs that relate to it.
Such log entries will now be displayed with a note below them explaining to the
current user that not all other users will be able to view them.
- Points types slugs to be generated from the name of the points type with any
spaces replaced with dashes. Previously when a points type was created, the slug
would be generated from the name, but any spaces would be removed, so if there were
multiple words they would be run together in the slug. Now if you create a points
type named "An Example", its slug would be "an-example", instead of "anexample". This
will not change the slugs of existing points types.

= 2.1.5 â€“ 2016-11-15 =

##### Fixed

- Network activated modules on multisite not being loaded on individual sites in the
network, unless some other modules were active on those sites. When no modules were
active on a site, the network-activated modules wouldn't be loaded either. This is
now fixed.

= 2.1.4 â€” 2016-11-08 =

##### Security

- Now using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator when creating
the security token used during major updates of the plugin. As is often the case,
this issue wasn't really exploitable, but we want to set a good example.
- Now uses all HTTPS links to WordPress.org and WordPoints.org. This makes it more
difficult for an attacker to send users to a fake website when they click these
links. Once again this is an extra precaution "just in case," and to set a good
example by following best practices.

##### Fixed

- Points being removed when a post was updated. Whenever a published post was
updated, points would be awarded and removed at the same time, and if the post author
had previously been awarded points, those points would be removed also. This is now
fixed, and the points that were added and removed in error will be corrected by the
update, along with the points logs.

= 2.1.3 - 2016-10-01 =

##### Fixed

- Issues when deleting a module. The module data wouldn't be shown correctly on the
Delete Module screen, and PHP errors would occur. A success message would be shown
saying that the module was deleted, but it would still be present. All of this is
now fixed, so your modules are no loner permanent.
- Reaction conditions not actually being removed when deleted. Reloading the page
would show that they were still there. This is now fixed, so your reaction conditions
are no longer indestructible either.
- Issues when cancelling editing a reaction. Weird things would happen, like a
duplicate Rate Limits section getting added, the Add Condition form being mangled,
and unsaved conditions not being removed. You no longer have to put up with this kind
of mayhem. At least not from WordPoints reactions.

= 2.1.2 - 2016-09-13 =

##### Fixed

- The form for legacy Rate Limits being displayed on non-legacy reactions. It is only
supposed to display on reactions imported with the Importer module.

= 2.1.1 - 2016-09-12 =

##### Fixed

- Rate Limits for reactions to the Visit event not working after the end of the first
time period. After the first period expired for a user, they would be awarded every
time they visited the site.
- The settings form for Rate Limits for reactions imported from CubePoints using the
Importer module not working correctly. The imported rate limits have to use a special
form, but the regular one was being displayed instead.

= 2.1.0 - 2016-08-10 - (countless hrs) =

**Requires: WordPress 4.4+**

##### Added

- New Points Types administration screen. This will eventually completely replace the
old Points Hooks administration screen. It includes a new UI for creating, updating,
and deleting points types, and for configuring when points are awarded in reaction to
different events that take place on the site. Because there are still a few minor
differences in the behavior of the code that underlies this new UI and the old points
hooks, the old points hooks have not yet been imported to the new screen. The plan
is to eventually achieve feature parity between the new hooks and the old hooks, and
then the old hooks will be automatically imported to the new screen.
- "Post content contains" condition for event reactions created on the new Points
Types screen. This means that you can have an event reaction fire only when a Post
contains a particular word or phrase.
- "User role" condition for event reactions created on the new Points Types screen.
This means that you can have an event reaction fire only when a user has a particular
role.
- Upload Media event (on the new Points Types screen), allowing points to be awarded
when a new file is uploaded to the media library.

##### Changed

- Heading levels on the admin screens to better match the rest of WordPress after
version 4.3.
- Most notices shown in the administration screens to be dismissible.

##### Deprecated

- The Points Hooks screen, as noted above. It will be removed in a future release.

##### Removed

- The ability to create, update, and delete points types on the Points Hooks screen.
This should be done on the new Points Types screen instead.
- Some of the language files (Greek, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese). These can now
be found on [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wordpoints).
The rest of the language files will be removed from the plugin in the future in favor
of WordPress.org's new language pack system. The Simplified Chinese translation is
already available as a language pack there. If you don't see your language, jump in
and start translating! Everyone is welcome.

##### Fixed

- Network administration menus being displayed in some cases on multisite even when
WordPoints wasn't activated network-wide.
- A notice incorrectly being shown when the ranks component was installed on
multisite.
- A fatal error when uninstalling the plugin if WordPoints modules had been
installed.
- Some modules not being uninstalled properly.
- Database error on multisite when uninstalling modules or components that had never
been activated.
- The user points data not being removed from the database for all points types when
the plugin was uninstalled on multisite.
- The Post Delete and Comment Removed points hooks not being displayed on legacy
sites where they are still used.
- [Dev-speak warning!] Symlinked modules not being uninstalled correctly (only file
removed, not data). [Told you!]

= 2.0.2 - 2015-09-26 - (~10 hrs) =

##### Fixed

- Since version 2.0.0, the plugin was not running its installation script when it was
activated. This caused the Points component not to be activated by default, made it
impossible to use the Modules screen, and, in some cases, also resulted in the site
sporadically entering maintenance mode. This update will automatically run the
install script on sites where it was not run on activation, which will fix all of
these issues.

= 2.0.1 - 2015-07-22 - (~5 hrs) =

##### Fixed

- In the table on the modules screen, the id of each checkbox is now based on the
module's file, instead of on the module name. This avoids duplicate ids when there
are multiple modules with the same name installed. Duplicate ids are not allowed,
and could have caused bugs on the Modules screen. You are now free to install as
many modules with the same name as you want without any fear of bugs ;-).

##### Security

- Use a stronger hashing algorithm to generate the keys for the points logs cache.
The use of a weaker algorithm could possibly have allowed a determined attacker to
view logs which they might not otherwise be able to.
- Use a stronger hashing algorithm to generate the key used to perform a module
compatibility check during a breaking update. This is not really a security concern,
because the time window for exploitation only lasts a few seconds, and all a
successful attacker would be able to do is view a list of modules installed on the
site.

= 2.0.0 - 2015-06-30 - (~70 hrs) =

##### Added

- Support for emoji! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨  You can now use them in points logs and rank names (and
other places, too).

##### Changed

- Many internal improvements. Great stuff is coming soon!

##### Removed

- Some old code was removed. This could break some modules, so if you are using a
custom module or plugin that integrates with WordPoints, you should test before
updating. WordPoints will attempt to detect incompatible modules when it is updated,
and will deactivate them if necessary.

##### Fixed

- The modules-per-page setting on the Modules screen was not being saved. You could
enter whatever value you wanted, but it wouldn't change a thing. You no longer have
to feel like your site is ignoring you.
- An error on the confirmation screen when attempting to delete a module. This would
happen for most modules, preventing them from being deleted. Your modules are no
longer permanent.
- The points logs cache was not being cleaned in certain cases, like when a user was
deleted. This would cause deleted logs to continue to display, if persistent caching
was being used. Your days of being haunted by zombie points logs are over.
- The `[wordpoints_user_rank]` shortcode wasn't using the default points type by
default. You always had to use the `points_type` attribute. Now that your fingers
won't be getting that extra exercise from typing, you may want to take them to the
gym.
- The loading spinner was not displaying on the Ranks screen while a rank was being
saved. It's now back, so you can stare at the center of it and see if you get
mesmerized.

= 1.10.4 â€” (~2 hrs) =
* Fixed: Users would see 0 instead of the correct number of points on the profile
admin screen.

= 1.10.3 - (~10 hrs) =
* Fixed: Closes 2 potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the points logs query
code. These are not exploitable within WordPoints itself, however, it is possible
that they could be exploited through custom code if it passes untrusted data to
the `points__compare` or `text__compare` query args.
* Fixed: Avoids the potential for directory listing of the modules directory on
improperly configured servers.
* Fixed: Closes any potential XSS vulnerabilities through developer error messages
on poorly configured installs (i.e., with `WP_DEBUG` enabled).

= 1.10.2 â€” (~6 hrs) =
* Fixed: There was a bug on multisite causing users from all sites to be displayed in
the top users table, instead of just users from the current site. Your users will now
stay out of each others leader boards.
* Fixed: There was a bug in the ranks component which would cause a user to be
promoted two ranks when they should have only been promoted one. Your users will no
longer cut rank on you.
* Fixed: There was a bug in the top users table that caused users who hadn't been
awarded any points yet to be ignored, even when they should have been displayed. Your
points-less users will no longer have to feel left out.
* Fixed: There was another bug in the top users table that would only affect sites
where users are allowed to have negative points. Any users with negative points would
be displayed above users who had never been awarded any points.
* Fixed: There was another bug in the top users table (yes, really!), for those using
persistent caching. The cache for the top users wouldn't be cleared when a user
registered or was deleted. This could cause the table to become stale in some cases.
You no longer have to feel nostalgia when you view the leader board.

= 1.10.1 â€” (~1/2 hr) =
* Fixed: The My Points widget no longer displays points logs to logged-out users.

= 1.10.0 â€” (~20 hrs) =
* Requires: WordPress 3.9+
* Fixed: Current points values not being displayed beside inputs on profile screen.
* Fixed: The modules cache being preserved too long when using persistent caching.
* Fixed: Other caching issues on multisite.
* Updated: Numerous other small fixes and minor improvements.

= 1.9.2 â€” (~2 hrs) =
* Fixed: A bug preventing updating a user's points from their admin profile when
they don't have any points yet.

= 1.9.1 â€” (~3 hrs) =
* Fixed: A bug preventing ranks from being saved or updated.

= 1.9.0 - (~65 hrs) =
* Updated: The title for the "Points" column in the points logs and top users tables
will be replaced with the name of the points type being displayed.
* Updated: Display the number of points a rank is for in the rank's title bar (on
the Ranks admin screen).
* Updated: Cache user ranks. May improve performance.
* Updated: Combine the Comment and Comment Removed points hooks once again. The
Comment hook will automatically remove the points if the comment gets removed, and
the Comment Removed hook is hidden on new sites. The old behavior is retained as
needed for current installs, but the Comment Removed hook will likely be removed in
2.0, so you are recommended to stop using it now.
* Updated: Combine the Post and Post Delete points hooks also. The Post hook now
automatically removes points when a post is deleted. Also, the old behavior is
retained on existing installs, but the Post Delete hook will probably be removed in
2.0 as well.
* Fixed: Better caching for the points logs. This could really improve performance
when viewing the logs.
* Fixed: Warn the user when they attempt to upload a module on the plugins screen.
* Fixed: On multisite, only load network-active modules on the network admin screens.

= 1.8.0 - (~55 hrs) =
* New: You can display the points of the current post's author using the
[`[wordpoints_points]`](https://wordpoints.org/user-guide/shortcodes/wordpoints_points/)
shortcode by supplying `post_author` as the value of the `user_id` attribute, like
this: `[wordpoints_points user_id="post_author"]`.
* New: Award points to post authors for comments they receive with the
[Comment Received](https://wordpoints.org/user-guide/points-hooks/comment-received/)
points hook.
* New: Display a user's rank with the [`[wordpoints_user_rank]`](https://wordpoints.org/user-guide/shortcodes/wordpoints_user_rank/) shortcode.
* Updated: Part of the install and update process is skipped when the plugin is
network activated on a very large multisite network (>10,000 sites).

= 1.7.1 â€” (~5 hrs) =
* Fixed: Ranks not saving in some cases. Thanks, @atomtheman10, for the report!
* Fixed: XSS vulnerability from the points logs admin screen. It was only exploitable by Administrators and Editors.
* Fixed: CSRF vulnerability for toggling accessibility mode on the Points Hooks screen. It would only have been an annoyance.

= 1.7.0 - (~80 hrs) =
* New: Create ranks for your users by activating [the Ranks component](https://wordpoints.org/user-guide/#ranks).
* * You can manage the ranks on the *WordPoints Â» Ranks* administration screen.
* * A user's rank is displayed along with their name in the Top Users table.
* * You can display a user's rank using the `%rank` placeholder in the WordPoints widget.
* Updated: Now requires WordPress 3.8+.
* Fixed: Display users who have never been awarded points in the Top Users table when appropriate.
* Fixed: CSRF vulnerability for adding a points type.
* Fixed: CSRF vulnerability for deleting a points type.
* Fixed: Many other small internal improvements.

= 1.5.0 =
* New: The Comment and Comment Removed points hooks now have a post type setting, like the Post points hook.
* New: Translation into simplified Chinese, provided by Jack Lee.
* Updated: The points hooks API for developers has received several improvements.
* * It is now optional to implement the `form()` and `update()` methods when extending `WordPoints_Points_Hook`.
* * The `WordPoints_Post_Type_Points_Hook_Base` class was introduced as a bootstrap for points hooks implementing a post type setting.
* * Other internal improvements, to be continued.
* Updated: The points logs are now cached, offering a performance benefit on sites with persistent caching.
* Updated: The points types are shown in two columns on the Points Hooks administration panel on devices with wide screens.
* Updated: By request, it is now possible to enable the use of HTML in the "WordPoints" widget using this code: `remove_filter( 'wordpoints_points_widget_text', 'esc_html', 20 );`
* Fixed: Module caching was broken because of a code typo.
* Fixed: When network active on multisite, the plugin did not install itself on new sites when they were added to the network.

= 1.4.0 =

* Updated: The post points hook has been split in to the Post and Post Delete points hooks.
* Updated: The comments points hook has been split into the Comment and Comment Removed points hooks.
* Updated: Calculate the periods for the periodic points hook relative to the calendar instead of the user's last visit.
* Fixed: Clean the points logs for comment approvals when a post is deleted, removing the dead link to the post.

= 1.3.0 =
* New: User avatars are displayed in the points logs table.
* New: Added [`[wordpoints_points]`](https://wordpoints.org/user-guide/shortcodes/wordpoints_points/) shortcode to display a user's points.
