/**
 * Bootstrap for representing an entity context.
 *
 * The entity API makes it possible to encapsulate different sorts of things (like
 * posts and users) so that their data can be accessed through a common set of
 * interfaces. Each entity has an IDâ€”a single piece of data (like an integer or
 * string) that can be used to identify that entity. The ID is unique to that entity,
 * but it is not *globally unique*. That is, it is unique to that entity only within
 * a particular scope or "context". For example, on multisite a post's ID is unique
 * only in the context of the site on which that post was published. That same ID
 * would refer to a different post on each other site on the network. The job of the
 * context API is to encapsulate the different sorts of contexts in which entities
 * can exist. This allows us to, for example, create globally unique IDs (GUIDs) for
 * entities, so that they can be identified specifically even outside of their usual
 * context.
 *
 * The context API can also allows us to switch from one context to another, so that
 * when we see that the GUID for a post indicates that it came from a different site
 * on the network, for example, we can switch to that site before performing an
 * operation involving the database.
